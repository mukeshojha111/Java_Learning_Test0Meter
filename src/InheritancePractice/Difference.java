/**
 1. Inheritance and Encapsulation:

Inheritance: It is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a Sub class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from Super class (Parent class). 
It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

Encapsulation: It is a concept that involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. 
Encapsulation helps in data hiding and protecting the internal state of an object.

2. Inheritance and Abstraction:

Inheritance: It is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a Sub class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from Super class (Parent class). 
It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

Abstraction: It is a concept that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
Abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, allowing for the definition of common interfaces without specifying the exact implementation.

3. Polymorphism and Inheritance:

Polymorphism: It is the ability of a single function or method to operate on different types of data or objects. 

There are two types: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).

Inheritance: It is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a Sub class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from Super class (Parent class). 
It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

4.Composition and Inheritance:
Composition: It involves creating complex objects by combining simpler ones. Instead of relying on a hierarchical relationship, composition uses relationships between classes where one class contains an instance of another class.
Inheritance: It is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a Sub class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from Super class (Parent class). 
It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.
